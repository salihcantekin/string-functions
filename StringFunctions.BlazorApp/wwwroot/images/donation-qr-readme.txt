Place your donation QR code image here as 'donation-qr.png'

The image should be:
- Square format (recommended 500x500 pixels or larger)
- PNG format with white or transparent background
- Contains your donation QR code (bank transfer, crypto wallet, PayPal, etc.)

If you don't have a QR code yet, you can generate one using:
- QR code generators online (qr-code-generator.com, qrcode-monkey.com, etc.)
- Bank app QR code for donations
- Cryptocurrency wallet QR code
- PayPal.me QR code

Simply replace the placeholder 'donation-qr.png' file with your actual QR code image.
